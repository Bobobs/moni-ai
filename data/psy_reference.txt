### Major Depressive Disorder
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. Common symptoms include low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. A diagnosis typically requires at least five symptoms, including either depressed mood or loss of interest.

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder
GAD is defined by chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, often without provocation. Symptoms include restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. These must be present more days than not for at least six months.

### Bipolar I Disorder
Bipolar I involves manic episodes lasting at least 7 days (or less if hospitalization is required), often followed by depressive episodes. Symptoms include increased energy, reduced need for sleep, inflated self-esteem, talkativeness, and risky behavior.

### Bipolar II Disorder
Characterized by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes seen in Bipolar I. Diagnosis requires at least one hypomanic and one major depressive episode.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
PTSD may develop after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Symptoms include intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative changes in mood and thinking, and hyperarousal. Symptoms persist for over a month and cause significant distress.

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
OCD involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that the person feels driven to perform. The compulsions are aimed at preventing or reducing distress but are often not realistically connected to the problem.
